                    protecting your personal information and informing you about 
                    how we use it. This privacy policy applies to transactions and 
                    activities and data gathered on any Uhitch service (the "Site") 
                    including but not limited to (1) the services available under 
                    the domain and sub-domains of www.Uhitch.me and (2) any Uhitch 
                    "widget" or service embedded on a third-party website such as a 
                    university, or other organization. Please review this privacy 
                    policy periodically as we may revise it without notice. This 
                    privacy policy was last revised on November 18, 2010. Each time 
                    you use the Site or provide us with information, by doing so 
                    you are accepting the practices described in this privacy 
                    policy at that time.

                <p>
                    Uhitch.me collects anonymous information through cookies. A 
                    cookie is a small piece of data containing a unique 
                    identification number that is sent to your browser from a Web

                    promotions, sweepstakes and contests; to identify the areas of 
                    the site you visit; to hold session information; and to track 
                    user preferences.

                <h3>Data We Collect From You</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information 
                    about products or services that may be of interest to you, we 
                    may collect "personal information" (i.e. information that could 
                    be used to contact you directly (without using the Site) such 
                    as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card 
                    information, or email address) or "demographic information" 
                    (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that 
                    is not personal information; this may include, but is not 
                    limited to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth 
                    date, browsing history information, searching history 
                    information, and registration history information. Demographic 
                    information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public 
                    information", which consists of ride transaction information 
                    and one-on-one communications between you and other users of 
                    the Site; and 2) "public information", which consists of all 
                    other demographic information. Please note that nowhere on the 
                    Site do we knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal 
                    information from children under the age of 18, as we require 
                    that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years 
                    old.
                </p>
                <h3>How We Use Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    We use your email address and your other personal information 
                    to help us efficiently operate the Site, to contact you in 
                    connection with your transactions and other activities on the 
                    Site (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or 
                    important news that could affect your relationship with the 
                    Site), to forward trip information to you from other Site users 
                    and to contact you and others to suggest potential carpool 
                    matches. These types of communications, are known as 
                    "Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational 
                    Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as 
                    banner ads and special offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To operate the Site, including processing your transactions and 
                    supporting your activities on the Site, we may share your 
                    personal information with our agents, representatives, 
                    contractors and service providers so they can provide us with 
                    support services such as email origination, receipt or support 
                    services, customer relationship management services, and order 
                    fulfillment. We require these entities not to use your 
                    information for any other purpose.

                <h3>How to Edit Your Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Uhitch.me believes strongly in giving you the ability to access 
                    and edit your personal information. To update your personal 
                    info, click My Account at the top of any page. There you can 
                    view, update and correct your account information. You may edit 
                    your profile at any time -- all you need is your username and 
                    password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there 
                    are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you 
                    cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are 
                    not allowed to register as Uhitch.me members, we need to take 
                    reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our members' 
                    ages. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our databases automatically update any personal information you 
                    edit in your profile, or that you request we edit. Information 
                    transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other 
                    means remain in our databases and become the property of 
                    Uhitch.me upon submission. Keep this in mind if you decide to 
                    communicate personal information through any of these 
                    applications.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Security Precautions</h3>
                <p>
                    Your Uhitch.me Profile is password-protected so that only you 
                    and authorized Uhitch.me employees have access to your account 
                    information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give 
                    your password to anyone. If someone who represents to you they 
                    are Uhitch.me staff asks for any personal account information, 
                    including password, check their URL. If it doesn't say they are 
                    support@uhitch.me, they're not. Also, if you share a computer, 
                    you should sign out of your Uhitch.me account and close the 
                    browser window before someone else logs on. This will help 
                    protect your information entered on public terminals from 
                    disclosure to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uhitch.me makes every effort to ensure that your information 
                    is secure on its system. Uhitch.me has staff dedicated to 
                    maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, 
                    periodically reviewing Web security and making sure that every 
                    Uhitch.me employee is aware of our security practices. 
                    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 
                    guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Uhitch.me cannot 
                    guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, 
                    and you do so at your own risk. If you have any further 
                    questions on this issue, refer to the site Terms of Use. 
                    Uhitch.me expressly disclaims any liability that may arise 
                    should any other individuals obtain the information you submit 
                    to this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Site has security measures in place to protect against the 
                    loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our 
                    control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained 
                    on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, 
                    province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which 
                    you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these 
                    computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as 
                    protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <h3>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</h3>
                <p>
                    If at any point we decide to use particular personally 
                    identifiable information in a manner materially different from 
                    that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users 
                    by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the Site. 
                    Uhitch.me also encourages you to review this privacy policy 
                    periodically. By using the site, you do hereby represent and 
                    warrant that you have read, understand and agree to all terms 
                    of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Each time you use 
                    the site, you agree to all terms set forth by Uhitch .me in 
                    both its Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and any other 
                    policies published by Uhitc.me on the site. If you do not 
                    understand any of the terms or conditions of any of Uhitch.me's 
                    policies. Please note that we will continue to have the right 
                    to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your 
                    personally identifiable information, without notice, as 
                    described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, 
                    provided that such changes shall only apply to information 
                    gathered on or after the date of the change.
